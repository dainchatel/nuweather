##### A disruptive new weather data startup, SkyCast Inc., reached out to you for your help with a small development project.

##### They are looking to change the way people read weather forecasts and would like a stable base to iterate from.

### APIs to Use

SkyCast is looking to leverage a weather API (https://developer.forecast.io) combined with a geolocation API
(https://developers.google.com/maps) to allow users to retrieve current as well as historic data about any location that the users search.

#### Deliverable:

SkyCast would like their users to be able to enter in any location and retrieve current/useful and future forecast information about the weather in that area. Also, a user should be prompted to allow tracking his/her location to display the weather data.

*How you tackle this deliverable is up to you, impress us! We suggest you take the following items into consideration while building your application:*

* A User should have a clean, mobile friendly, representation of the weather data.
* A User could login in order to use this application

* A User could track and retrieve their own search history.

##### Submission

For your assignment, create an application that satisfies the requirements as listed. Please host the application on a platform of your choice EXEPT Github, and make sure it is available and runs from any browser. Package your source code and submit via email in its entirety. Make sure to include a link to a deployed version in the body of the email.

If the requirements are unclear, feel free to reach out with any questions, but do realize this exercise is a chance for you to show off your abilities to turn requirements into features.
